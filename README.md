# cardinal-web-server

This package is a microservice that is used by the server Cardinal apps (CLI and desktop). Both of those apps implement this package independently of eachother.

The web server delivers the client apps to the user, streams media, manages WebSocket connections, and some other stuff that I can't remember but I don't care because I will rewrite this readme.

This is just a copy straight from the desktop server app for now.
