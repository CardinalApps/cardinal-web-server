# Andromeda

Andromeda is the name of the Progressive Web App that is the Cardinal Music UI.

Cardinal Server includes this PWA with its releases, and serves it at the
`/music` endpoint.

The Cardinal Music Electron app also includes this PWA with its releases, for
the purposes of offline playback (meaning disconnected from Cardinal Server).
